In this ME, i have implemented the frontend for a fully fledged E-commerce website in React. The learnings included

Using state and props to deal with the data

Routing users to different views

Using REST APIs to communicate with the backend

Local storage to identify users when revisiting

Utilising the useState and useEffect hooks effectively

Making use of custom hooks like React Router useHistory() and Notistack enqueueSnackbar()

Using 3rd party library for easily prototyping the UI elements

Making the website responsive

Conditionally rendering UI elements

Lifting state up to handle for cases where sibling elements need access to the same data

Debouncing to improve search feature

Deployment using Vercel and Render
